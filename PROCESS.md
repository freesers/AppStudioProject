# Day 1
Today I submitted my final proposal at https://github.com/freesers/AppStudioProject/blob/master/README.md
I'm planning to make a WieBetaaldWat-like app for cleaning schedules in student houses. After consulting with a TA i found out the server component can be done using FireBase. 

# Day 2
Today I submitted my (first) design document and I met with my group (H)

The user first logs in or registers, the is presented with a tab bar controller between three main screens. Then there will be a couple loose viewcontrollers either presented modally or with a show - detail style.

The first ideas on how the data should be modeled. The main structures are Users (detailing user information) and Chores.

# Day 3
Today I mainly foccused reading the Human Interface guidelines and working on my prototype. Spent the day reading up on FireBase, articles from John Sundell (https://www.swiftbysundell.com) about GCD and the basics of UserNotifications

# Day 4
The day started off with our first team meeting with Emma, we discussed our projects and prototypes. Fried (teammember) mentioned that he had had a TA telling him FireBase might be too big for the scope of this project. And to use a local server instead. I'm personally not sure yet whether I want to use it or not, as a local server would kind of defeat the purpose of this app. I finished the day with completing my prototype and reading more about FireBase Realtime Storage
